                <p>Just a Burger? Just a burger.</p>  
                <p>Robin, it's so much more than "just a burger." I mean... that first bite-oh, what heaven that first bite is. The bun, like a sesame freckled breast of an angel, resting gently on the ketchup and mustard below, flavors mingling in a seductive pas de deux.</p>
                <p>And then... a pickle! The most playful little pickle! Then a slice of tomato, a leaf of lettuce and a... a patty of ground beef so exquisite, swirling in your mouth, breaking apart, and combining again in a fugue of sweets and savor so delightful. This is no mere sandwich of grilled meat and toasted bread, Robin. This is God, speaking to us in food. </p>

            <p>Is there anything that can compare to a delicious burger?</p>
            <p>You know, the sort that makes noises around the table that can only mean, "Wow, this is some delicious stuff," pours down your chin, and needs multiple napkins. </p>

                        <li>Kosher salt</li>
                        <li>8 cups finely shredded green cabbage (from a 1 1/2-pound head)</li>
                        <li>1 cup distilled white vinegar</li>
                        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
                        <li>2 tablespoons yellow mustard seeds</li>
                        <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
                        <li>5 large shallots, very thinly sliced crosswise and separated into rings</li>
                        <li>1/4 cup Wondra flour (see Note)</li>
                        <li>1 1/2 pounds ground beef chuck, preferably 85 percent lean</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon sweet smoked paprika</li>
                        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
                        <li>Freshly ground pepper</li>
                        <li>6 ounces extra-sharp cheddar, shredded</li>
                        <li>2 cups baby arugula</li>
                        <li>4 brioche buns, split and toasted</li>

                        <li><div class="directions-ul-number">1. </div> In a large bowl, toss 1 tablespoon of kosher salt with the cabbage and massage it until it softens and releases its liquid, about 4 minutes. Drain the cabbage in a colander and rinse it.</li>
                        <li><div class="directions-ul-number">2. </div> Wipe out the bowl. Add the vinegar, sugar, mustard seeds, 1 cup of water and 1 tablespoon of salt. Add the cabbage to the vinegar mixture, toss to coat and place a plate on top to keep it submerged. Let stand at room temperature for 2 hours.</li>
                        <li><div class="directions-ul-number">3. </div> Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, heat 1 1/2 inches of vegetable oil to 325°. In a medium bowl, toss the shallots with the Wondra flour. Fry the shallots all at once, stirring gently, until golden, about 7 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the shallots to a paper towel–lined plate to drain. Season the shallots with salt. Reserve the cooking oil.</li>
                        <li><div class="directions-ul-number">4. </div>In a medium bowl, combine the ground beef with the onion powder, garlic powder, smoked paprika, Worcestershire sauce and 2 teaspoons each of kosher salt and ground pepper. Knead gently until thoroughly mixed. Form the beef into eight 4-inch patties. Press the shredded cheese into four 2 1/2-inch disks. Sandwich the cheese disks between the patties. Pinch the edges together to seal.</li>
                        <li><div class="directions-ul-number">5. </div>Heat a grill pan or griddle. Brush the burgers with some of the shallot cooking oil and cook over moderate heat until browned on the bottom, about 3 minutes. Flip the burgers, invert a large heatproof bowl over them and cook until medium within and the cheese is melted, about 3 minutes longer.</li>
                        <li><div class="directions-ul-number">6. </div>Mound the arugula on the bun bottoms and top with the burgers. Drain the pickled cabbage and mound some of it on the burgers; reserve the rest of the pickled cabbage for another use. Top with the fried shallots and the bun tops and serve.</li>
